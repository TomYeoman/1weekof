# 1weekof

Keeping upto date with all topics required to work on the modern web there can be a full-time job. There is an infinite rabbit hole to ascend with any given topic.

The goal of this series is to over the next 6 months explore (or re-explore) a range of topics I find interesting, time-boxed to 7 working days per topic ( evenings / weekends as I have a full-time job to keep up with also! ).

Just how much can we learn in 7 days?
