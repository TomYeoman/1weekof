# 1weekof
The pace of technology can be overwhelming, particularly when working in the web there is an infinite rabbit hole to ascend with any given topic.   The goal of this series is to over the next 6 months explore (or re-explore) a range of topics I find interesting, time-boxed to 7 working days per topic ( evenings / weekends as I have a full-time job to keep up with also! ).   Just how much can we learn in 7 days?
