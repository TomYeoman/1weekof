## Overview

Modern day front-end positions are a multi-disciplinary job, and if you're like me you probably have a near infitinite list of subjects you would like to cover / re-cap on.

## Plan

The goal of this series is to over the next 6 months explore (or re-explore) a range of topics from this list - time-boxing each subject to 7 days  ( evenings / weekends as I have a full-time job to keep up with also! ).

Just how much can we learn in 7 days?
