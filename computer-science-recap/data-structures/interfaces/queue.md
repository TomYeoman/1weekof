# Queue

## Summary

Stack's are `first-in first-out` data structures (FIFO).

There are variations of this such as priority queues. For example if we're handling video on our site we may prioritize video streaming packets over syncing of a file to dropbox could wait

## Methods

`ENQUEUE (add / push)` - Add something to the back of the array
`DEQUEUE ( remove / pop )` - Take something off the front

## Usage

An example of where we might use this would be for printing. If we're the first one to put a job on the queue then we should ge the rights to use ut first
