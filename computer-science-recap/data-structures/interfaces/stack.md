## Summary

Stack's are `Last-in first-out` data structures (LIFO). You've probably heard them many times before with the term "Stack overflow" - due to the language working with stacks.

They are very useful for modelling certain things ( Particularly programming languages ). Any modern ( Often C based ) languages operates on stacks as this is what makes most sense to us.
